__**Challenges**__

The app is simple but does a few things on the javascript side that make it unique. One of the stipulations was that any quote displayed must be able to be posted on twitter. Not all quotes from the API are with in the Twitter character limit so I had to pre-filter Quotes before they were posted on the web page. Most of the time this is rather quick but sometimes the API will send multple non-twitter friendly quotes in a row that will delay the app from showing new quotes. In addition I had to build my own twitter button because twitters pre-built buttons were not able to work with the design of the App.
